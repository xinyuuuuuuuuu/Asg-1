Design Process 
This website is on an artist 'NIKI'. I am rebranding her website into a more minimalistic look. I have displayed a introduction page on her as an artist, tours dates, her discography from the start of her career, a store page, a newsletter page to subscribe to if the user would like to egt updates from her and a login page. 

As a user who might want to know more about NIKI, i can navigate through the website, browse the different pages there are. In the about page, i can know more about her as an artist adn what she has achieved during her career. In the tours page, i can check out the dates and location of her current tour if it is ongoing, if not i can subscribe to her website, this allows me to receive updates on her and tour dates if she has any new tour. I can check out the discography page, which is separated from the oldest song from her debut in 2017, to new songs she released in 2023. I can check out the merch that is available on the website and i can also login as a member through the login page. 

The adobe XD wireframe will be included in the project folder.

Features
feature 1 - In the discography page, users can use the scroll-bar to scroll through NIKI's discorgraphy. It is not part of the main screen, it is inside the main screen which makes it more convenient to scroll 

feature 2 - In the home page, users can scroll through a slideshow that displays the newest album and single from NIKI, there are social  media icons next to the slideshow. Users can click on them which brings them to the page of the social media icon (for example, instagram, spotify). This feature is also availble in the about page. 

features left to implement - i would like to use javascript for the cart for the store page. Unfortunately, i am not very skilled in javascript and hence, was unable to make the cart for the page.

https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/arrows/ - i use the icon for the left arrow and right arrow for my slideshow.
pinterest, google - most of the pictures that i used was from pinterest and google.

w3schoolds - i have referenced w3schools for some of my code as i was unsure on how to fix it.

Testing
It works fine on the broweser. However, it is awkward on mobile, since i  did not have enough time to do the media query.
